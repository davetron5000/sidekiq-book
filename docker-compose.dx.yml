# Docker Compose is a way to run several containers on the same network such
# that all containers can see each other and interact, the same as you might
# have in a real production deployment.
#
# Each container is configured via a service, so the top key is required
# by Docker to be this: 'services:'
services:
  # The key inside services: is a name that will be the hostname of the service on the virtual
  # network.  As such, they can be anything that can be a hostname.
  #
  # This is the container that you will do your work in. It has all
  # the stuff needed for Rails development installed and you can run all
  # Rails commands in here.
  sidekiq-book:

    # This is the name of the image to use to start the container.
    image: davetron5000/sidekiq-book:0.0.1

    # This says that if the image is missing locally, pull it
    # from DockerHub.  In this case, you will build this image locally.
    pull_policy: "missing"

    # This hash indicates other services that this container depends on.
    # This means that this container won't be started until these services
    # satisfy the given condition

      # The names of this hash are the service names from this file.
      db:
        # The condition can be 'service_healthy' or 'service_started'.
        # Since this entire file is for development, 'service_healthy' is not workable, because
        # it requires at least one health check to be completed, and the very first health check
        # is delayed by the period configured for health checks.  Meaning you are waiting 5, 10, or however
        # many seconds.  That is no good, so we just wait for the service to be started.

    # This says to run an init process in the container instead of using
    # the "entrypoint" command as the init process.  This is here because
    # the effect of adding this means this container will stop MUCH more
    # quickly than if it's omitted. That's the only reason.

    # This exposes port 22 to the other containers started by this file.
    # For your purposes running the dev environment, you don't need this, but
    # the build system for the book uses this to ssh into this container
    # to run commands.  The book's build system is built on top of this
    # so to keep everything as the same as possible, this is here.

    # A _volume_ is a virtual disk available to the container.  It is a list.
    volumes:
      # This volume is a "bind" volume, meaning it binds a directory
      # inside this container to a directory on your computer
      - type: bind
        # This is the source directory on your computer that should be bound
        # to the container.  In this case, it's the sidekiq-book folder right here.
        source: "./sidekiq-book"
        # This is the path to the directory inside the container.  This means that
        # inside the container if you change a file in /root/work/sidekiq-book that change
        # will be reflected on your computer's ./sidekiq-book and vice versa. Docker syncs
        # everything for you

    # Each container must have an entrypoint that is run when the container starts. Unlike
    # a virtual machine, a Docker container doesn't just sit there. But in our case, we want
    # just that.  This container will run this shell script, which prints a help message
    # and waits forever.  See that file + Dockerfile.dx for more info
    entrypoint: /root/show-help-in-app-container-then-wait.sh
    # This is the default directory where commands are run from.

  # Because this service is named "db", you can access it over the virtual
  # network via the hostname "db".

    # that was used to create the image being used for this container.
    # You can examine that Dockerfile on DockerHub

    pull_policy: "missing"
    # This sets a value in the environment. In this case, we have to set
    # a value for the password for postgres. Since this is just for dev, it
    # can be hard-coded in here to "postgres", which is also hard-coded
    # in sidekiq-book/.env.development and sidekiq-book/.env.test
